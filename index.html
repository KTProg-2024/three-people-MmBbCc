      <div class="aaa">
        <h2 >John Brown</h2>
        <img src=https://www.battlefields.org/sites/default/files/styles/scale_crop_380x370/public/thumbnails/image/John%20Brown.jpg?itok=t6MhtGpZ width=333 height=342><br>
        <i>John Brown was born in a Calvinist household and would go on to have a large family of his own. Facing much financial difficulty throughout his life, he was also an ardent abolitionist who worked with the Underground Railroad and the League of Gileadites, among other endeavors. He believed in using violent means to end slavery and, with the intent of inspiring a slave insurrection, eventually led an unsuccessful raid on the Harpers Ferry federal armory. Brown went to trial and was executed on December 2, 1859.</i><br><br>

        The reason I admire John Brown is because he took the action he felt was necessary against the very cruel practices of his day, he was brave & righteous.

        <i>Theodore Roosevelt, bynames Teddy Roosevelt and TR, (born October 27, 1858, New York, New York, U.S.—died January 6, 1919, Oyster Bay, New York), 26th president of the United States (1901–09) and a writer, naturalist, and soldier. He expanded the powers of the presidency and of the federal government in support of the public interest in conflicts between big business and labour and steered the nation toward an active role in world politics, particularly in Europe and Asia. He won the Nobel Prize for Peace in 1906 for mediating an end to the Russo-Japanese War (1904–05), and he secured the route and began construction of the Panama Canal (1904–14).</i><br><br>

        I admire Roosevelt mainly for one policy of his & that was his anti-trust laws which broke up the gigantic & very powerful monopolies in American society at the time, that was a really good thing & we should probably do it again.

        <h2>Noam Chomsky</h2>
        <img src=https://static.dw.com/image/46620912_303.jpg width=350 height=197><br>
        <i>Avram Noam Chomsky (born December 7, 1928) is an American linguist, philosopher, cognitive scientist, historian, social critic, and political activist. Sometimes called "the father of modern linguistics", Chomsky is also a major figure in analytic philosophy and one of the founders of the field of cognitive science. He is Laureate Professor of Linguistics at the University of Arizona and Institute Professor Emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and is the author of more than 150 books on topics such as linguistics, war, politics, and mass media. Ideologically, he aligns with anarcho-syndicalism and libertarian socialism.</i><br><br>
        Text taken from <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky>here</a><br><br>
        I admire Noam Chomsky because he is a very well learned person who's research & thoughts have been highly influential in several fields, which is why he is among the most cited Academics in the world, he is incredibly accomplished & admirable.
